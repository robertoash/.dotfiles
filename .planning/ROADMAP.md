# Roadmap: Dotfiles Management

## Overview

The dotfiles system is architecturally sound but lacks operational tooling for safe deployment, visibility, and quality assurance. This roadmap closes table-stakes gaps (dry-run, health checks, drift detection) that every competing tool already has, then adds developer experience improvements that build on that foundation. Phase 2 is optional scope, pursued only if phases 1-2 prove their value.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

No phases defined yet.
