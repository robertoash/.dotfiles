# Fallback DNS servers for systemd-resolved
# These are used when no other DNS servers are available
# (e.g., when disconnecting from Mullvad VPN or Tailscale)
#
# Per-link DNS (from Mullvad, Tailscale, etc.) will take priority
# over these fallback servers

[Resolve]
# Fallback DNS: Local pi-hole instances, then public DNS
FallbackDNS=10.20.10.50 10.20.10.100 1.1.1.1 9.9.9.9

# Enable DNS over TLS for fallback servers (optional, but recommended)
# DNSOverTLS=opportunistic

# Cache DNS queries to improve performance
Cache=yes

# Read /etc/hosts for local hostname resolution
