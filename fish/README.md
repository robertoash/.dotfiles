# Fish Shell Configuration

This directory contains a complete migration of your zsh configuration to fish shell format, maintaining the same modular structure and functionality.

## Directory Structure

## Key Differences from Zsh

### Syntax Changes
- `export VAR=value` → `set -gx VAR value`
- `local var=value` → `set -l var value`
- `$@` → `$argv`
- `$1, $2, ...` → `$argv[1], $argv[2], ...`
- `[[ condition ]]` → `test condition`
- `function_name() { ... }` → `function function_name ... end`

### Features
- Fish has built-in autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- No need for external plugins like zsh-autosuggestions
- Built-in advanced tab completion
- `fish_add_path` for PATH management

### Auto-loading
Fish automatically loads:
- All `.fish` files in `conf.d/` (in alphabetical order)
- All `.fish` files in `functions/` as functions
- All `.fish` files in `completions/` as completions

## Migration Notes

### Replaced Tools
- **fasd** → **zoxide** (better fish integration)
- **fzf-tab** → fish's built-in completion system + fzf integration
- **zsh-syntax-highlighting** → fish's built-in syntax highlighting
- **zsh-autosuggestions** → fish's built-in autosuggestions
- **zsh-history-substring-search** → fish's built-in history search

### Manual Review Needed
Some functions may need manual adjustment for:
- Complex shell scripting patterns
- Advanced parameter expansion
- Conditional logic that doesn't translate directly

### Testing
To test the fish configuration:

```bash
# Install fish if not already installed
sudo pacman -S fish  # or your distro's package manager

# Test the configuration
fish -c "source ~/.config/fish/config.fish"

# For WezTerm usage (recommended approach):
# Just launch wezterm - it's configured to use fish automatically
wezterm

# Set fish as system default shell (optional - not needed for wezterm-only usage)
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
```

### WezTerm Integration
Your wezterm configuration has been set to:
- **Always use fish shell as the default**
- No special launching required - just open wezterm and you get fish

This means:
- Keep zsh as your system default shell
- WezTerm always uses fish automatically
- Other terminals (alacritty, etc.) still use zsh
- Perfect for testing fish without changing your entire system

## Compatibility Notes

- All your aliases are preserved
- All environment variables are preserved
- All functions have been migrated (may need tweaking)
- Key bindings adapted to fish syntax
- Application integrations updated for fish

The configuration maintains the same modular structure as your zsh setup, making it easy to maintain and modify individual components.
